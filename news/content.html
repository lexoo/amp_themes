<p>Available on HMRC&apos;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/employment-related-securities">website</a>, the 2015-16 versions of the forms are very similar to the ones organisations were required to fill in last year.</p>

<p>Businesses that operate employee share schemes or reward members of staff with securities have until <strong>6 July 216</strong> to complete and submit the new documents.</p>

<p>However, the system crashed as the deadline approached last year, so companies may be well-advised to give themselves plenty of breathing space.</p>

<p>There has been criticism from some quarters that changes to the Enterprise Management Incentive template are inconsistent.</p>

<p>Any queries regarding the new forms should be raised with HMRC.</p>
