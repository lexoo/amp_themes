Every year, they attract thousands of applicants from around the world, competing for a handful of positions in each programme. </p>

<p>Many applicants are from outside the European Union. So if that&apos;s you, read on&#x2026;</p>

<p>As a non-European entrepreneur you will not only need to beat the competition to get into the accelerator. You&apos;ll also need a visa if the accelerator requires you to stay in the UK during the programme.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the thing:</p>

<p>There are <strong>five</strong> accelerators in the UK that can potentially give you an advantage in the visa process. These accelerators can not only support your application to enter the UK, but will significantly lower the amount of investment funds needed to secure a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visa.</p>

<p>The entrepreneur visa normally requires &#xA3;200,000 in investment funds, but because these accelerators are &apos;endorsed&apos; by the UK government, the amount drops to &#xA3;50,000.</p>

<p>The accelerators are&#x2026;</p>

<p><strong>Things to look out for</strong></p>

<p><em>Covering the shortfall</em></p>

<p>Note that the investment amounts currently offered by Oxygen Accelerator (up to &#xA3;33,000 if there are three founders) and Wayra ($50,000) are less than the &#xA3;50,000 threshold for the entrepreneur visa. </p>

<p>If you&#x2019;re applying for these accelerators (or any in this list for that matter) you could still come to the UK as a &#x2018;prospective entrepreneur&#x2019; on a six month, Standard Visitor visa. Then later - provided you meet the investment conditions - switch into an entrepreneur visa. Make sure you raise your visa status with them up front and find out exactly what your options are. </p>

<p><em>Entrepreneur teams</em></p>

<p>In most cases, founders will apply to an accelerator as a team. The entrepreneur visa lets you share the same investment funds with up to one other entrepreneur visa applicant. </p>

<p>This works well for two co-founders, but might cause issues for teams of three or more founders if they all need a visa. Again, flag the issue up front so you know where you stand.</p>

<p><strong>Find the right expert</strong></p>

<p>The UK visa process is difficult even for the most sophisticated entrepreneurs. Not only are the rules complex (and ever changing), you&apos;ll need to supply a vast amount of documents and evidence to support your application. </p>

<p>Accelerators will often recommend or partner with immigration lawyer who can help you through the process. But remember, immigration law spans everything from Tier 1 visas to asylum cases - the best lawyers focus on particular niches. </p>

<p>If you&#x2019;re introduced to an immigration lawyer, ask them:</p>

<ul>
<li>how many Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visas have they done <em>for startups?</em></li>
<li>which startups, accelerators and investors have they worked with?</li>
<li>what contacts have they developed at the Home Office?</li>
<li>what&#x2019;s the current time frame for processing applications (e.g. how long did their last application take)?</li>
<li>regarding costs: what&#x2019;s the government fee (currently between &#xA3;944 - &#xA3;1,180) and how much is their <em>professional fee?</em> (ask for fixed fees, not hourly rates)</li>
<li>does their fee include ongoing advice and work <em>after</em> submitting the application?</li>
</ul>

<p>Many lawyers are happy to do a free initial call or consultation for you to ask these questions. So shop around. They&#x2019;ll need a solid understanding of your circumstances to give you a fixed quote, so expect them (in fact, demand of them) to ask you questions.</p>

<p>Once you&#x2019;re feeling reassured and confident in their expertise, then perhaps you&#x2019;ve found the right match. But don&#x2019;t be afraid to <a href="https://www.lexoo.co.uk/tier-1-entrepreneur-visa-lawyer">get a second opinion</a>. It&#x2019;ll take a little more time, but when it comes to visa applications, there&#x2019;s a lot at stake.</p>
